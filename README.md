## About

Fully responsive mobile and web application to track personal gym workout results. Useful for beginners and pros alike. The application focuses on user friendliness.

## Installation

Install with opening two terminals, one in the backend folder and one in the frontend folder. With both enter "npm i" to install and "npm start" to start the backend and frontend. When both are running, scan the QR code in the frontend terminal to open the app in your mobile device. Alternatively type "w" in the frontend terminal to open the app in your web browser.

## Using Workout Tracker

First time users must create an account before logging in, which is quick and easy with no email validification. Username must be 4 characters minimum and password 10 characters minimum. Once logged in, login is automatic until the user logs out of their account.
